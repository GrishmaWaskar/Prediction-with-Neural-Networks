# Forest Fire Prediction with Neural Networks.
- This project aims to predict the burned area of forest fires using neural networks.
- It includes both regression and classification tasks to predict the extent of forest fires and whether an area has burned or not.

# Dataset.
- The dataset used in this project contains information about various parameters related to forest fires, including weather conditions and environmental factors. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Month: Month of the year (1-12)
- Day: Day of the month (1-31)
- FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code
- DMC: Duff Moisture Code
- DC: Drought Code
- ISI: Initial Spread Index
- Temp: Temperature (in Celsius)
- RH: Relative Humidity (in %)
- Wind: Wind speed (in km/h)
- Rain: Rainfall (in mm)
- Area: Burned area of the forest fire (in hectares)
  
# Aim of the Project.
- The aim of this project is to develop predictive models using neural networks to accurately forecast the burned area of forest fires.
- Additionally, the project aims to classify whether an area is likely to experience a forest fire based on various environmental and weather parameters.

# Objectives.
- Build and train neural network models for both regression and classification tasks using forest fire data.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Investigate the impact of different neural network architectures and hyperparameters on model performance.
- Compare the performance of neural network models with traditional machine learning algorithms for forest fire prediction.  

# Methodology.
## Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Obtain a dataset containing information about forest fires, including weather conditions and environmental factors.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
## Model Development: 
- Develop neural network models for regression and classification tasks using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, optimizers, and regularization techniques to optimize model performance.
  
## Model Training and Evaluation: 
- Train the models using the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and accuracy for classification.
  
## Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models using techniques such as grid search or random search to improve performance.

## Comparison with Baseline Models: 
- Compare the performance of the neural network models with baseline models or traditional machine learning algorithms for forest fire prediction.

# Results.
- The neural network regression model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 23.323 on the test dataset.
- The neural network classification model achieved an accuracy of 90.38% in predicting whether an area is likely to experience a forest fire.

# Conclusion.
- Neural network models show promise in accurately predicting the burned area of forest fires and classifying areas prone to forest fires based on environmental parameters.
- The performance of the models can be further improved through fine-tuning of hyperparameters and experimentation with different architectures.

# Real-Life Impact.
- Accurate prediction of forest fire occurrence and estimation of burned areas can aid in early warning systems and resource allocation for firefighting efforts.
- By identifying high-risk areas, authorities can implement preventive measures and policies to mitigate the impact of forest fires on ecosystems and communities.
- The development of reliable predictive models can contribute to better environmental management and conservation efforts in fire-prone regions.
